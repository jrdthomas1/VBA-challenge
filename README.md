# VBA-challenge
Module 2- Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx spreadsheets and outputs the following:
-Ticker symbol
-Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
-The total stock volume of the stock.

Additionally, I added functionality to return the stock with the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest Volume.
* Conditional formatting was also used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red for "Quartely Change" and "Percent Change" columns
